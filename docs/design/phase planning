## Phases:

**Phase 1 - MVP:**

These are the most critical components required to get the application functional and ready for initial users:

1. **User Management:** Registration, login, and profile management.
2. **Donation Management:** Functionality for users to donate items.
3. **Marketplace Management:** A platform to display the donated items for other users to claim.
4. **Notification System:** Notifying users of new items on the marketplace.
5. **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for specific items in the marketplace.
6. **Basic Admin Management:** Admins can manage users and items.
   
**Phase 2 - Enhanced User Experience:**

The goal of this phase is to improve the user experience and engagement:

1. **Advanced User Verification:** Implement phone number verification for increased security.
2. **Item Categories and Tags:** Users can browse items based on categories and tags.
3. **User Ratings and Reviews:** Users can rate and review each other based on their experiences.
4. **In-App Messaging:** Users can communicate with each other regarding donations, claims, and general inquiries.
5. **Promotions and Incentives:** Encourage users to donate more by offering a points system or other incentives.
6. **Community Forum:** Implement a community forum where users can discuss, share experiences, ask questions, etc.

**Phase 3 - Advanced Features and Scalability:**

This phase is about adding advanced features to expand the reach of the application and make it more robust:

1. **Geolocation Features:** Show items based on the user's location.
2. **Social Media Integration:** Allow users to share items on social media platforms.
3. **Accessibility Features:** Implement accessibility features to make the app usable by people with disabilities.
4. **Multilingual Support:** Offer multiple language options for a global user base.
5. **Mobile Application:** Develop a mobile application for iOS and Android.
6. **Data Analytics and User Behavior Tracking:** Use advanced analytics to understand user behavior and optimize the app.
7. **APIs for Third-Party Integration:** Build APIs that allow third-party applications to integrate with your service.
8. **Partnerships with NGOs and other Organizations:** Partner with NGOs and other organizations for better distribution of donated items.



## Functional Requirements:


1. **User Management**: This includes user registration with OTP and email verification, login/logout, and profile management.

2. **Donation Management**: This will allow users to make donations, view their donation history, and possibly recurring donations. This also includes a feature for users to request items.

3. **Marketplace Management**: Users can view available items in a versatile marketplace. New items that are donated appear in this marketplace.

4. **Notification System**: Users receive email notifications when new items are donated.

5. **Admin Management**: This will allow admins to manage users, donations, and the marketplace.

6. **Search Functionality**: This allows users to search for specific items or other users in the marketplace.

7. **Reporting and Analytics**: To track the progress and performance of donations and item requests.

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **Performance**: The system should be able to handle a large number of users and transactions simultaneously.

2. **Security**: User data should be secure, and transactions should be encrypted.

3. **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale up to accommodate growth.

4. **Reliability**: The system should have high availability and low downtime.

5. **Usability**: The system should be user-friendly and intuitive.

6. **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to maintain and update.



## Tech Stack:

1. **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for a robust, scalable, and maintainable application.

2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript for handling server-side logic.

3. **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, donation data, campaign data, etc.

4. **Testing**: Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end tests.

5. **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for version control and code collaboration.

6. **CI/CD**: Use AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

7. **Hosting**: AWS (Amazon Web Services) - specifically EC2 for hosting the application, S3 for static files, and RDS for the database.

8. **Monitoring and Performance Testing**: Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring the application and Apache JMeter for performance testing.



## Testing Strategy:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components of the application.

2. **Integration Testing**: Testing the integration between different components of the application.

3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing the application as a whole, from start to finish.

4. **Performance Testing**: Testing the application under load to ensure it can handle a large number of users and transactions.



## Deployment Strategy:

1. **Continuous Deployment**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline. This will automatically build, test, and deploy the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

2. **Environment Management**: Maintain separate environments for development, testing, and production. This ensures that untested changes don't affect the live application.

3. **Database Migration**: Use a tool like MongoDB's mongomirror or AWS Database Migration Service to handle database migration.
